# Snake Game 🐍

Welcome to my Snake Game project! This classic Snake Game is implemented using Python's Turtle graphics library, providing a nostalgic gaming experience. The snake grows longer as it consumes the blue food items, and the goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
