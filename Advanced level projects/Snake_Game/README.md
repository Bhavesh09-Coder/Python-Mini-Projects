# Snake Game üêç

Welcome to my Snake Game project! This classic Snake Game is implemented using Python's Pygame library, providing a nostalgic gaming experience. The snake grows longer as it consumes the green food items, and the goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
