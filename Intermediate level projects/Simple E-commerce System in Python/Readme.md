# Simple E-commerce System

This project is a basic implementation of an e-commerce system using Python. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as object-oriented programming, user interaction, and simple data management. The system allows users to view products, add items to a shopping cart, and checkout.

## Features

- **View Products:** Browse a list of available products, including details such as price and stock quantity.
- **Add to Cart:** Add items to your shopping cart with specified quantities.
- **View Cart:** View the items in your cart along with the total price.
- **Checkout:** Complete your purchase, which clears the cart and updates product stock levels.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main classes:

- **Product Class:** Represents individual products with attributes like ID, name, price, and stock.
- **ShoppingCart Class:** Manages the shopping cart, allowing items to be added, viewed, and checked out.
- **Store Class:** Manages the store's inventory, allowing products to be added and viewed.
